# hello-world
standard hello world to learn code :)
For a good part of my professional career, I've worked on the internet - writing. However, I've always
wanted to know what happens behind the scenes when I request for a web page. That's when the web development
bug hit me. Now, I'm transitioning from writing (although it's still great to write something up), to
coding (still writing but even greater).
